# autoSC
FFXI Windower addon to help with opening and closing skillchains

By defualt it will cycle all available WSs and check to see if one is at the target *level* and if it is will fire it. If none at target level are found will fire the highest tier available that has been allowed for closes.

* filter <ws name> - Will add the named WS to the filtered list for the currently equipped weapon. This disables the use of the named WS when using the currently equipped weapon
  * WS filters are saved per weapon so if filter Burning Blade while on War with Naegling equipped it will also be filtered on every other job you use Naegling on.

#### ToDo:
* Aeonic AM recognition to allow Aeonic WS to be used for closing L4
* Add T4 SCs
  * Can now close T4 and recognizes T4 but doesn't always honor double T3 ...
  * Double T3 are being recognized as closed, mostly
* Maybe add autoRA and gearswap interaction
* Add Job Ability SC effects, Konzen-Ittai for instance
* Add magic and ability SC closers, Blu spells, pets, etc.
